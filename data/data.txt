// MISSING
// Mark Completed // Add Completion date rather than just deleting. Will need ability to cleanup old tasks.
// Someday/Maybe  // ????? just a low priority?
// WaitingFor:    // a Tag??   Task needs tracked but nothing possible now due to waiting on something to happen.
// InProgress:    // Long running tasks: e.g. Reading a book, started but unlikely to finish by date. Make a "this month" task and let it roll on.
// PRIORITY:      // 1-5: Show urgent things in a seperate list or sort to the top of long lists
// COMPLEXITY:    // 1-5: Simple 5 min tasks should be easy to show in a seperate list
// Tags:  @Video, @Book, @Computer, @Phone, @Home, @Office, @LongRunning, @Outdoor
//    Group things together by mood/location: i.e. Physically active things i.e housework. Outdoor/Shopping things. Things done at computer.
